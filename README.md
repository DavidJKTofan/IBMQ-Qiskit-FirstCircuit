# IBMQ-Qiskit-FirstCircuit
Building my first quantum circuit and creating entanglement between 2 qubits with Qiskit and IBMQ. <br>

# What is Qiskit?
"Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms." <br>

For more info visit their official website: https://qiskit.org/ <br>

# What is IBMQ?
"IBM Q is an industry first initiative to build universal quantum computers for business, engineering and science. This effort includes advancing the entire quantum computing technology stack and exploring applications to make quantum broadly usable and accessible." <br>

# YouTube Tutorial
I am interested in Quantum Computing and IBMQ, and therefore I recently started watching the YouTube tutorial from Qiskit about how to get started with Qiskit. I will be playing around with Qiskit and IBMQ and will be publishing more files in the near future. <br>
